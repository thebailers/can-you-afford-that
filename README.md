A simple money manager using React and Firebase - never go overdrawn again! [Now retired - please see my money-manager repository for the new app!]

This is still in very early stages of development, some data acts as placeholder content

## Setup
(Currently setup with Firebase which is free for development: https://www.firebase.com/)

- Setup your Firebase account, create a new base and make a not of the Firebase URL. You will need this in a minute.
- Install NPM dependencies `npm install`
- Rename scripts/config.js.dist to config.js and update it with your firebase URL
- Run gulp tasks from the root `gulp`

Then hit load sample data and start saving!
